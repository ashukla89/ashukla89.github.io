    <div class="story-body">
      <p class="body-text serif">By now, everyone knows that people are leaving San Francisco in droves. It’s pricey AF, the tech bros are insufferable, and there’s poop everywhere. What, some have begun to ask, is left to stay for?</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">I’ll tell you what. The running.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">As someone who’s recently left San Francisco for New York after living there his entire adult life, I can tell you personally: we who go running do not know how good we have it. And the reason is nothing less than our lame, milquetoast weather.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">Skeptical? Try this: fly to New York in May (when I moved) and go for a run. I dare you. Try not to be, as I was, gobsmacked by lung-bursting amounts of moisture-laden hot air. Your splits will suffer. You will shun any incline. You will want to die. And that’s before summer has even started.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Don’t take my word for it. Instead, allow me to marshal science to make all of you active Bay Areans who would leave think twice. I started my inquiry with a simple question-- how good is the weather for running in SF, and how does that compare to other cities that San Franciscans move to?</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">I’m glad you asked, too.</p>


      <h3 class="section-head serif">Which cities do people leave SF for?</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">I could have done this analysis myself, but the good capitalists at <a href="https://www.trulia.com/research/californians-are-leaving-where-are-they-looking-to-go/">Trulia</a> did it for me. Their methods weren’t perfect (see the methodology if you’re a big nerd), but here are the top 5:</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">
      <ul>
        <li>New York</li>
        <li>Las Vegas</li>
        <li>Phoenix</li>
        <li>Dallas</li>
        <li>Seattle</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">In other words: suck it, Austin.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">And what does it mean for running weather to be “good?”</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">Surely this is subjective, you say? Wrong! The intrepid reporters at <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/wellness/best-temperature-for-running/2023285">Elite Daily</a> have determined that the optimal temperature for running long-distance is 49-50 F, and for sprinting it’s 72-73 F. Since all runs are, by definition, somewhere between a sprint and long-distance run, we’ll call those our bookends and include all temperatures in between.
      </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">But also: running in the rain sucks (chafing, anyone?), so we’ll want to take that into account too.
      </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">So to sum up, good running days are:
      <ul>
        <li>Those with <strong>high temps between 50 and 72.5.</strong></li>
        <li>Those with <strong>no rain recorded.</strong></li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">So how do the cities compare?</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">Again, so glad you asked. I pulled 39 years of temperature and precipitation records from the NOAA, and determined on average how many days per month in each city have high temperatures in that sweet spot range, and also feature no rain. And the results are in:
      </p>

      <div class="chart-section">
        <p class="chart-title">Guess what - San Francisco wins</p>
        <p class="chart-subhead">It gets more than double the number of running days as the others.</p>
        <div class="chart-row">
          <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/days_cities_edit.png"/>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="chart-source">Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (ncdc.noaa.gov)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="body-text serif">But that doesn’t help us see when the weather is good for running. This does:
      </p>
      <br>

      <div class="chart-section">
        <p class="chart-title">You can run in San Francisco year round</p>
        <p class="chart-subhead">In other cities, it's seasonal at best.</p>
        <div class="chart-row">
          <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/heat_cities_edit.png"/>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="chart-source">Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (ncdc.noaa.gov)</p>
      </div>

      <p class="body-text serif">Basically:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SF has pretty great running weather year round.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Seattle and New York are temperate,</strong> with bad running weather in the winter and the summer. The shoulder seasons are pretty okay-- but they’re longer in Seattle, giving Seattle a distinct edge over NYC.</li>
          <li><strong>Vegas, Phoenix, and Dallas have terrible summers.</strong> Their winters are actually great for running, though-- particularly in Vegas.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">So we should plan the rest of our lives based on this data?</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">No, no you should not. Why? <strong>Climate change.</strong></p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Comparing just the last 19 years (2001-2019) with the previous 20 (1981-2000), the cities have diverged even further.</p>

      <div class="chart-section">
        <p class="chart-title">San Francisco has gotten a lot better for running</p>
        <p class="chart-subhead">The other cities are mostly getting worse.</p>
        <div class="chart-row">
          <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/days_change_edit.png"/>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="chart-source">Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (ncdc.noaa.gov)</p>
      </div>

      <p class="body-text serif">But that's not the whole story. Just because Seattle has roughly the same number of running days doesn’t mean that its running days happen at the same time as before.</p>
      <br>

      <div class="chart-section">
        <p class="chart-title">West Coast cities have seen big seasonal shifts</p>
        <p class="chart-subhead">Other cities are losing running days on the margins.</p>
        <div class="chart-row">
          <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/city_change_edit.png"/>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="chart-source">Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (ncdc.noaa.gov)</p>
      </div>

      <p class="body-text serif">In Seattle, for example, the number of good running days hasn’t changed, but their distribution has. Seattle has more good running weather in the winter months, but markedly less in the summer and fall.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">But SF is better basically all the time.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">Why is SF so much better now?</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">Part of the answer is the same stuff that’s happening everywhere-- warming winters (and in SF’s case, somewhat less rainy ones) means better weather for outdoor activity.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">But the biggest reason SF is improving on running days is more surprising: since 2000, the number of days that are too warm for running has actually declined-- and in a big way.</p>

      <div class="chart-section">
        <p class="chart-title">San Francisco has fewer extremely warm days.</p>
        <p class="chart-subhead">Even if average temperatures are going up, fewer days exceed 72.5 degrees now compared to before.</p>
        <div class="chart-row">
          <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/sf_heat_edit.png"/>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="chart-source">Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (ncdc.noaa.gov)</p>
      </div>

      <p class="body-text serif">It’s another reminder that climate change has both its winners and losers: in San Francisco, like maybe not that many other places in the world, the winners are runners-- and the losers are people who like to do things like stand outside relaxing, barbequing, and generally not being too active under a warm summer sun. In other words, normal summer stuff -- which for now, San Franciscans aren’t getting any more of.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">So if you hate the cost of living and like to lay about during the summer, by all means leave. But if you’re one of the many who like to be outside, wafted by a bracing Pacific breeze-- you can’t do much better than stay.</p>
