      <h1 class="headline">As Ukraine Tilts West, Its Politicians Ditch the Russian Language</h1>
      <h2 class="subhead">But the trend has been downward irrespective of who's been in charge.</h2>

      <p class="body-text">Even as Russia has stepped up its meddling in Western elections, recent political events have made Ukraine, long part of the Russian orbit, embrace the West-- and that orientation is reflected in the language that its politicians speak.</p>
      <p class="body-text">In short, they've gradually been eschewing Russian (which most Ukrainians speak natively) in favor of the national language, Ukrainian, when making speeches in Parliament.</p>
      <p class="body-text">But even as Russian in parliament becomes rarer, year-to-year shifts in political orientation haven't meant much. In 2004, the "Orange Revolution" resulted in a hard turn westward-- but in subsequent years, Russian use in Parliament actually went up slightly. Conversely, the election in 2010 of the same pro-Russian president who was thwarted six years earlier had no effect on Russian's downward slide.</p>
